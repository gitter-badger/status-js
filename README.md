<strong>WIP. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION. HIGH RISK âš </strong>

## Install
clone the repo via git:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/status-im/status-js.git
```
And then install the dependencies with `npm`.
```
$ cd status-js
$ npm install
```

`status-js` requires `geth` or `murmur` to be able to connect to Whisper. If using `geth`, you may start it with the following flags.

`geth --testnet --syncmode=light --ws --wsport=8546 --wsaddr=localhost --wsorigins=statusjs --rpc --maxpeers=25 --shh --shh.pow=0.002 --wsapi=eth,web3,net,shh,debug,admin`

Also, due to the lack of nodes with Whisper enabled, you need to create a [static-nodes.json](https://github.com/status-im/murmur/blob/master/src/data/static-nodes.json) file, that must be placed in a specific path (if using testnet and Linux, `~/.ethereum/testnet/geth/static-nodes.json`

## API
*TODO*
See test files for use in the meantime
